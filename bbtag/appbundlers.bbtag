title:A comparison of Linux app bundlers;
color:54b7e5;
description:**There are several different app bundlers available for Linux, such as Snaps, Flatpaks, and AppImages.**
**Each of these creates an executable that includes its own libraries.**

**__Snaps__**
**• Sandbox applications.**
**• Update automatically without user interaction, which can unfortunately cause breakage with no clear indicators.**
  
**__Flatpaks__**
**• Don't follow system themes, you must have a flatpak installed for the theme.**
**• The flatpak package manager has also been known to have issues with dependencies.**
  
**__AppImages__**
**• Not sandboxed, but are completely self-contained.**
**• Each AppImage can update itself (but won't do so without telling the user).**
**• This means that AppImages don't require a package manager or additional software, making them completely portable.**

**Because of these comparative features, if you need to use a bundled application we recommend using AppImages if possible.**}}
