Panda Wireless makes a few WiFi dongles that work out of the box on pretty much any Linux distro.  They are a good solution if you have a built in WiFi chip that isn't supported/doesn't work well on Linux and are relatively cheap.  The model linked above is small enough to not be in the way on a laptop (image to right).
