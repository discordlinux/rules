description:Xubuntu is an [official Ubuntu flavor](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours) that uses the [Xfce Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce).  It is often considered to be the most stable Ubuntu flavor.  As is the case with all [official Ubuntu flavors](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours), Xubuntu has access to all of the packages in Ubuntu's repositories and can use PPAs created for Ubuntu.

fields.name:<:think:585665071938666508> Should You Use Xubuntu?;
fields.value:If you are looking for a Linux distribution that is light on resources, very easy to use, extremely stable, and highly customizable, it doesn't get much better than Xubuntu.  The only problems some people may have with Xubuntu are the default looks and the slow release cycle of Xfce, but the looks are easily changed, and the release cycle of Xfce is the main reason that Xubuntu is more stable than other Ubuntu flavors.
**[Download Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/download/)**

If you'd like something a bit more modern feeling than Xubuntu, we recommend checking out Ubuntu MATE (see `sudo info ubuntu mate`) or KDE neon (see `sudo info KDE neon`).}}
