description:**• Not a recommended Linux distro due to on-again, off-again security concerns.
• Maintains separate repositories for all software (including kernel), often out of date compared to the upstream Debian equivalents.
• Repositories are not well maintained.  Deepin repos have been known to included things that can't be redistributed along with other weird things.  For example, [Blank's no longer maintained Discord wrapper](https://github.com/XNBlank/discord-linux) was in their repos for quite some even though the official Linux Discord client was available at the time.
• Until recently, transmitted data on screen size, IP addresses, and physical location of users in plaintext through the Deepin App Store ([relevant video](https://youtu.be/11QqMUgzuo0)).
    
[KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org) provides [Deepin look and](https://store.kde.org/p/1243751/) [feel packages](https://store.kde.org/p/1238270/) (see `{prefix} info kde neon`).
See `sudo info recommended` for a list of recommended distros.**}}
