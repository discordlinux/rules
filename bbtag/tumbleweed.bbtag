**__Updating openSUSE Tumbleweed__**
• ***Always*** **use `zypper dup` to update Tumbleweed.  Anything else will not move the system to the next rolling release and will most likely cause issues with orphaned packages.
• Tumbleweed is updated when new packages in the Factory repos have passed [openqa testing](https://openqa.opensuse.org).  There are typically multiple updates released per week.
• It is recommended that all Tumbleweed users follow the [Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory) for information about new updates.**
**__Media Codecs__**
**• openSUSE cannot include certain media codecs due to license issues.  See the [Tumbleweed wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) for instructions on how to install them.**
**__openSUSE Build Service__**
**• The OBS can be used to find packages not in the default repos, find newer versions of packages, make changes to existing packages, or to create your own packages.
• The [openSUSE software search](https://software.opensuse.org/search) site can be used to find and install packages from the OBS.
• [zyp](https://software.opensuse.org/package/zyp) can also be used to find and install packages from the OBS.
- `zyp` is a wrapper for `zypper` that adds searching for and installing packages from the OBS along with a few other features.
- Repos for packages installed from the OBS with `zyp` are added with a lower priority than the default repos to avoid replacing system packages.
- An [openSUSE account](https://build.opensuse.org/session/new) is required to use `zyp` as the API for the OBS requires authentication.
