{dump;### Welcome to Discord Linux, {username}!

#### Glory to the Tux

- Before you begin chatting away, there are a few rules that you should familiarize yourself with. Please note that these rules do not cover everything, and punishment given for reasons not listed is subjectable to staff's discretion.

- If there are ever any issues with staff members, be sure to direct any and all complaints to `@sans` with a detailed message of what the complaint is.

### General Rules

#### #1 - Be respectful

- Includes personal insults, demeaning behavior, and inflammatory language.
- Know when a debate has turned into an argument.
- Above all else, listen and cooperate with staff members.

#### #2 -No NSFW or illegal content
- Includes porn, gore, pirated software, talking about illegal activites, etc.

#### #3 - No spamming or irrelevant messages{semi} English only

- Sending an unreasonable amount of messages in a short time or messages that are unrelated/unwanted is considered spam.
- Posting large blocks of text may also be considered spam{semi} please use the sudo pastebin command, hastebin, or paste.rs.
- Abusing bots is considered spam.
- This is an English only server{semi} refrain from chatting in other languages.

#### #4 - Use the channels as intended

- Please read the channel topics before using them.
- If the conversation you are having is more suited to another channel, please move it there.

#### #5 - Don't link to or advertise other servers

- If you want to spread the word about your server, do so elsewhere.
- Server invites will be deleted automatically and result in a warning.

#### #6 - Don't use a selfbot

- Selfbotting is against Discord's Terms of Service.
- More annoying than useful.
- If you find `@sudobot` lacking, feel free to make suggestions in #offtopic.

#### Moderators have final say in the enforcement of these rules or other infractions.

- Don't attempt to loophole or use semantics to get around these rules.
- Respect the intent behind them, not the literal text.

### Punishment System

#### Restricted Words

- Messages containing Discord invite links and certain restricted words will automatically be deleted by `@sudobot`.
- Posts containing these words will result in a warning in #mod-logs.
